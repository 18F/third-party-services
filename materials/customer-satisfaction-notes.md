## Overview of Customer Satisfaction Research

#### Research Methodology

We're currently pursuing four methods to research customer satisfaction tools in use by federal websites.  

* Searching listserve archives for the phrase `"customer satisfaction"` to find previous threads on the topic.  
* Googling for products and articles on the topic.  
* Interviewing subject matter experts at GSA.  
* Scanning the homepages of federal websites to generate a list of third party services and then manually reviewing the resulting domains to look for potential candidates. 

#### Results 

[This issue](https://github.com/18F/third-party-services/issues/2) is being used to keep a list of any customer satisfaction tools that we learn are used by federal websites.  
  
[This section](https://github.com/18F/third-party-services/blob/master/materials/catalog-of-services.md#customer-satisfaction-tools) of the catalog of services is being used to track known domains used by customer satisfaction tools.
